"""Torch compatibility helpers.

Some environments (including some Colab images) may default `torch.load()` to
weights-only loading, which breaks Ultralytics YOLO `.pt` checkpoints.

We patch `torch.load` to default `weights_only=False` when the argument exists
and the caller didn't explicitly set it.

This is a pragmatic demo/deploy safeguard.
